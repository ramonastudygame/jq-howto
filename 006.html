        GLOBAL SCOPE = all variables that are defined outside of functions (and inside of functions without the var keyword) are declared in the global scope, and
        <br>
        LOCAL SCOPE =  all variables defined inside of functions can only be accessed by those functions (and any inner functions).
        <br>
        Whenever you see a function within another function, the inner function has access to the scope in the outer function, this is called Lexical Scope or Closure - also referred to as Static Scope.   Scope chains establish the scope for a given function. Itâ€™s always the position in the code that defines the scope. When resolving a variable, JavaScript starts at the innermost scope and searches outwards until it finds the variable/object/function it was looking for.
